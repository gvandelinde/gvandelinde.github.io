# Code of Conduct
### 1. Core agreements/axioms
- **Punctuality**: Group members are deemed to be present at the exact moment as arranged (preferably 5 minutes early to grab a cosy cup of coffee). To realise punctuality we keep track of late appearance. After 3 times of showing late as a friendly punishment a person is to bake a cake for the group to enjoy together.
- **Presence**: Each group member is to be present 4 days a week. This will be coordinated through our presence-sheet.
- **Directness**: Group members are expected to be honest and be critical towards each other. Feedback should be positive and direct.

### 2. Documents
- All documents shall be written in the English language.
- All process-related documents shall be written in markdown.
- Agendas should follow our agenda template. 

---
### 3. Process-orientated
##### 3.1 Meetings
- The group is to discuss progress and problems they walked into during a meeting at the start of the day. We approximate these meetings to take about 20 minutes.
-  The Monday morning (unless not possible) the group shall discuss the sprint for the upcoming week. This meeting will take slightly longer than the daily meetings and requires presence of all group members.
- Weekly meetings with the client are to be scheduled as to keep the progress of the project in line with the ideas of the client.
- Roles for meetings(i.e. chair and notetaker) will be allocated randomly every week.
- Agendas for meetings are to be created at least the day before a meeting

##### 3.2 GitLab
- Merge-requests need at least 2 approves before they can be merged.
- Group members are expected to thoroughly review each other's code, leave comments and ask questions when unclarity arises.  
- Issues in GitLab should hold labels corresponding to their priority, which will follow a MoSCoW approach.
- GitLab issues are to hold a status label indicating whether they are: on the backlog, being worked on, in-review or finished.
- Merge-requests should be responded to within a span of 24 hour (on week days) as to prevent big (and plainly annoying) merge-conflicts.

---
### 4. Communication
- Group members are expected to check the Discord server and the WhatsApp group regularly. They are supposed to check these mediums at least twice a day.

--- 
### 5. Product-orientated
- Code should be easy to comprehend, so that it is also easy to maintain. Where necessary appropriate comments should be placed. Comments should also not be overdone.
